# Food-Menu

I have created a web page using HTML language and little bit of CSS
,Which allows users to browse Recipes.

When the user selects a meal, the details of that meal show:
• Name of the dish
• Image of the dish
• A List of ingredients including measures
• Instructions how to prepare the dish
